# TopDownShooter

Made in C++ and Raylib in 8-ish hours
<br><br>

All sound effects made using [sfxr](https://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html)
<br>

Background Music: [Not Jam Music Pack](https://not-jam.itch.io/not-jam-music-pack) by [Not Jam](https://not-jam.itch.io/)

## NOTE
I made this game as a challenge to myself to do something. I'm probably not going to update this code again
